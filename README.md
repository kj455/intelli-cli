# ü§ñ Intelli-CLI

Intelli-CLI is a command-line tool that leverages the power of ChatGPT to help you find the exact command you want to execute.

## üåÖ Installation

To install Intelli-CLI, run the following command:

```bash
$ brew install kj455/tap/intelli-cli
```

You can then use the -h flag to view the help information:

```bash
$ intelli-cli -h
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Before you can use Intelli-CLI, you will need to obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Once you have your API key, run the following command and enter your key:

```bash
$ intelli-cli auth login
```

Your API key will be stored locally using [go-keyring](https://github.com/zalando/go-keyring).

## üöÄ Usage

To use Intelli-CLI, provide a description of the task you would like to accomplish:

```bash
$ intelli-cli q <description>

# Example:
$ intelli-cli q "go command to format all files in this directory"
```

Intelli-CLI will then provide you with a list of suggestions. Select the one that best fits your needs and press enter to execute the command.

If you would like to just preview the command before executing it, you can use the `--dry` or `-d` flag:

```bash
$ intelli-cli q <description> --dry
```
